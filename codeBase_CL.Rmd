# Introduction

  This report documents data analytics process for obesity comorbidity analysis on data retrieved from NCBI. This is an assignment from Brown University's the CIS Data Science Practice for assessing Chloe Li's technical skills.
  
  *NOTE: Select **Hide Code** to hide all R codes.*

  The objective of tis assignment is to conduct a comorbidity analysis for obesity using NCBI's PubMed database. The data was selected based on a date range of __2000 to 2012__, with a major MeSH descriptor of __"obesity"__ and semantic types of __"Disease or Syndrome"__.

#rentrez is the package in R provides an interface to the NCBI's EUtils API
```

#Methods

1. Data retrieval from PubMed.
2. Data processing on PubMed data
3. MeSH descriptors XML parsing and processing
4. Mapping MeSH descriptors to PubMed data
5. Data analysis



# Data Retrieval

In order to retreive data based on date range and keywords, a correct search query should be formulated. The package of R named "rentrez" allows R users to pull data from NCBI. 

## PubMed Search

**entrez_db_summary()** shows summary of a certain database, in this case, **PubMed** database is used. 

- Database summary: **PubMed**
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#show the database summary information
entrez_db_summary("pubmed")
```

**entrez_db_searchable()** shows searchable fields under a certain database, users can decide which keywords should be put under which searchable field. 

- List of **PubMed**'s *searchable fields* (below only shows **MAJR**)
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Searchable fields for database 'pubmed'
searchField <- entrez_db_searchable("pubmed")

searchField$MAJR
```

- In order to form the PubMed/MEDLINE search for articles between 2000 and 2012 with obesity indicated as the major MeSH descriptor, elements below should be included in the query:
    + *__MAJR__ - MeSH terms of major importance to publication* is used as searchable fields
    + **2000/01/01:2012/12/31[PDAT]** is date of publication/[PDAT]
    + **pubmed** is the database


Below shows the search result, which contains 59515 records and a web_history object; Here is the summary of search result:
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
query <- "obesity[MAJR] AND 2000/01/01:2012/12/31[PDAT]"

obesity_search <- entrez_search(db="pubmed",
                        query,
                        retmode = "xml",
                        use_history = TRUE,
                        retmax=60000)

kable(summary(obesity_search))
```

- A _web histroy_ was returned as well, which NCBI created for users who deals with very large queries. With this _web history_, all records based on the search query were stored on NCBI server waiting for further usage. 
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
obesity_search$web_history
```


- **The formulation of the PubMed search is shown below:**
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

obesity_search$QueryTranslation

```


In order to make sure this search result match with the number of records on NCBI. The same searching criteria were used on NCBI website manually, and the result is shown below:

## Fetch Data

Based on the search query, all records that matched with the criteria were found and all IDs were returned. Those IDs or the web history could be used to fetch all records from NCBI.
However, NCBI only allows users to pull 10,000 records at once. Therefore, a web history needs to be used to save the search result in the server so that all 59,515 records can be pulled from multiple batches. 

- Obtained PubMed/MEDLINE records (in MEDLINE or XML format) for the formulated search using NCBI E-Utilities 
- Extracted "pmid","authors","year","articletitle","meshHeadings" from all records and stored values into a data frame.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#fetch all records from the formulated search
source('./batchFetch_Fun.R')

#this returns a data frame with extracted information from all records
dt_sum <- batchFetch(obesity_search)
#function code will be shown at the end of this report

#save dt_sum in local so don't need to run every time
#write.csv(dt_sum, "obesity_SumTable.csv")
#dt_sum <- read.csv("obesity_SumTable.csv")
#dt_sum$X <- NULL

```


- Sample of the data frame

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(dt_sum[1:3,])
```

## Data Processing

To prepare the data for further analysis, two variables *authors* and *meshHeadings* should be re formatted since there are multiple values in one record for both variables. 
*authors* and *meshHeadings* variables should be unlisted so that each row represents an unique record of meshHeadings and authors with pmid, publication year and article title.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('./unlistDT_Fun.R')

#return a data frame of 5 variables with each cell contains only single value
dt_tidy <- unlistDT(dt_sum)
#write.csv(dt_tidy, "tidy_obesitySearch.csv")
```


- Sample of the data frame
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(dt_tidy[1:5,])
```




# Mapping

- Goal: create mapping of MeSH descriptors to semantic types using the MeSH Vocabulary file (desc2015.xml) and identify descriptors with type **Disease or Syndrome**
- Link to MeSH Descriptors XML file: _ftp://nlmpubs.nlm.nih.gov/online/mesh/2015/desc2015.xml_

## Dictionary

Parse MeSH descriptors XML file:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#download XML file - 2015 MeSH descriptor
MeSHdescriptor <- XML::xmlParse("ftp://nlmpubs.nlm.nih.gov/online/mesh/2015/desc2015.xml")
#meshList <- xmlToList(MeSHdescriptor)
```

- In order to map MeSH descriptors to semantic types, **DescriptorName** and **SemanticTypeName** were extracted from the XML file above for the purpose of creating a dictionary, which later was used to link the MeSH descriptor from PubMed search.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#extract value from xml
source("./ExtractDict_Fun.R")
dt_MeshDict <- ExtractDict(MeSHdescriptor)
```

Summary of the dictionary before cleaning:
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(dt_MeshDict[1:5,])
```


The above record contains variables that have multiple values per row/record since one meshHeading might associate with multiple SemanticTypeName. In order to get the data ready for mapping, the data frame needs to be transformed and each cell should be unlisted so that each cell contains only single value.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#unlist variables (tidy)
source("./MeshDict_Fun.R")
tidy_Dict <- MeshDict(dt_MeshDict)

#reorder
tidy_Dict <- dplyr::arrange(tidy_Dict, SemanticTypeName)

```

Sample of the MeSH-SemanticType dictionary

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(tidy_Dict[1:10,])
```

## Mapping
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#save the dataframe in case
dt_PubMed <- dt_tidy

#merge/VLOOKUP to map the semantictype to dt_PubMed
dt_Mapped <- merge(dt_PubMed, tidy_Dict, by="meshHeadings",all.x=TRUE)

#rearrange columns and rows
dt_Mapped <- dplyr::select(dt_Mapped, pmid,meshHeadings,SemanticTypeName,articletitle,authors,year)
dt_Mapped <- dplyr::arrange(dt_Mapped, SemanticTypeName)

```

Sample record of mapped PubMed search:
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(dt_Mapped[1:5,])
```


## Data Processing

- Remove meshHeadings == "Obesity"
- Select only SemanticTypeName == 'Disease or Syndrome'
- Data is ready for analysis:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#remove meshHeadings that are 'Obesity'
dt_filter <- dplyr::filter(dt_Mapped, meshHeadings != 'Obesity')
#select only 'Disease or Syndrome' as SemanticTypeName
dt_filter <- dplyr::filter(dt_filter, SemanticTypeName == 'Disease or Syndrome')
#check if neccessary
#str(dt_filter)
kable(dt_filter[1:5,])
```


# Analysis

Goal: Use a statistical or modeling approach to identify and to rank comorbidities for obesity based on publications that share MeSH descriptors for multiple disease or syndrome.

## Trend
- Let's take a look at the trend on publications about obesity from 2000-2012:


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
search_year <- function(year, term){
    query <- paste(term, "AND (", year, "[PDAT])")
    entrez_search(db="pubmed", term=query, retmax=0)$count
}

Year <- 2000:2012
papers <- sapply(Year, search_year, term="Obesity[MeSH Major Topic]", USE.NAMES=FALSE)

dtPlot <- data.frame(Year, papers)
dtPlot$Year <- as.character(dtPlot$Year)

ggplot(data = dtPlot, aes(x=Year, y=papers,group=1)) +
    geom_line(colour="light blue", size=1.5) +
    geom_point(colour="black") +
    ggtitle("Trend for Publications on Obesity") +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Number of Papers")

```

As the line chart above shown, the number of publications with **Obesity** as major MeSH topic was increasing over the period of 2000 to 2012. Over time, the trend held consistent increase rate but from 2003 to 2004, it seemed that there was a large increase on the number of pulications on obesity. 

## Ranking

- Here is a sample record of unique **pmid** count on **meshHeadings**:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#group by meshHeadings and count number records for each MeSH
meSH_count <- setDT(dt_filter)[, .(count = uniqueN(pmid)), by = meshHeadings]
meSH_count <- as.data.frame(meSH_count)
#rarrange
meSH_count <- dplyr::arrange(meSH_count, -count) 
meSH_count <- dplyr::select(meSH_count, meshHeadings,Count = count)

kable(meSH_count[1:10,])
```


- Histogram of top 25 disease or syndrome:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#subset the top 25 records
Top25 <- meSH_count[1:29,]
Top25 <- dplyr::filter(Top25, meshHeadings != "Life Style"& meshHeadings != "Health Behavior" & meshHeadings != "Feeding Behavior"&meshHeadings != "Quality of Life")
                        

ggplot(Top25) +
    geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(meshHeadings, Count),y=Count),stat="identity",fill = "orange") +                               #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
                              ggtitle("Top Comorbidities for Obesity") +
                              xlab("Disease or Syndrome") +
                              ylab("Number of pmid") +
                              coord_flip()#+


```


# Conclusions
   The most common complication of obesity is **Insulin Resistance** syndrome while the second most common complication is  **Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2**. Among top most comorbidities of obesity, most of diseases or syndromes fall under the category of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, according to the trend of number of publications on obesity, it was certain that many researches and discussions were on obesity.
